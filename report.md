### **Report on Neural Network Inference Framework Designs**

#### **1. Introduction**
This report outlines the design of a neural network inference framework capable of processing a pre-trained model (ONNX format) and performing inference on an input image. The framework was evaluated using three different approaches:
1. **C++ with OpenCV** - Utilizes the OpenCV library for image preprocessing.
2. **C++ with GStreamer** - Employs GStreamer for image handling, avoiding OpenCV.
3. **Python** - Implements the solution in Python with OpenCV for ease of use.

**Assumptions:**
1. The model is pre-trained, optimized, and possibly quantized.
2. Model weights are in an interchangeable format such as ONNX. The ONNX Runtime API is used, but other frameworks like TFLite could be employed.
3. The example demonstrates an image-based classification model but can be extended to tasks such as segmentation, depth estimation, etc.
4. The framework assumes CPU-based inference but can be adapted for GPU-based inference.

**Limitations:**
1. The provided code is not a complete production-ready solution.
2. Certain logic is simplified for clarity and could be expanded in a more comprehensive framework.
3. Familiarity with GStreamer is limited; some code is adapted from previous implementations.

#### **2. C++ with OpenCV**

**2.1 Design Overview:**
- **Model Loading**: Uses ONNX Runtime (ONNX RT) for managing and executing the model. ONNX RT is known for its performance and versatility.
- **Preprocessing**: Relies on OpenCV for reading, resizing, and normalizing images. OpenCV is a well-established library in computer vision.
- **Postprocessing**: Determines the predicted class by identifying the highest probability in the output tensor.

**2.2 Design Choices:**
- **OpenCV for Preprocessing**: Selected for its simplicity and comprehensive image processing capabilities. It integrates well with C++ and is effective for tasks like resizing and normalization.
- **ONNX Runtime**: Maintained for its performance optimization and ease of use.

**2.3 Workflow:**
1. Load the model using ONNX Runtime.
2. Preprocess the image with OpenCV: read, resize, and normalize.
3. Perform inference with the preprocessed image.
4. Postprocess the results to identify the predicted class.

**2.4 Limitations:**
- **Dependency on OpenCV**: Introduces a significant dependency, which may be unnecessary in minimal environments.
- **Resource Usage**: OpenCV can be resource-intensive, potentially limiting its suitability for memory-constrained applications.

**2.5 Why OpenCV Version:**
- OpenCV functions were identified as beneficial during implementation discussions.
- The use of OpenCV for image manipulation is deemed suitable for the current context.

#### **3. C++ with GStreamer**

**3.1 Design Overview:**
- **Model Loading**: Uses ONNX Runtime for model management and inference.
- **Preprocessing**: Replaces OpenCV with GStreamer for image processing. GStreamer is a multimedia framework designed for handling video streams and low-level multimedia handling.
- **Postprocessing**: Processes the output tensor similarly to the OpenCV version to find the predicted class.

**3.2 Design Choices:**
- **GStreamer for Preprocessing**: Chosen to provide an alternative to OpenCV, especially useful for environments where OpenCV may not be supported. GStreamer is lighter and effective for low-level handling of images.
- **ONNX Runtime**: Continues to be used for model inference due to its efficiency and broad support.

**3.3 Workflow:**
1. Load the model using ONNX Runtime.
2. Preprocess the image with GStreamer: handle loading, resizing, and RGB extraction.
3. Execute inference on the processed image.
4. Postprocess the results to determine the predicted class.

**3.4 Limitations:**
- **Complexity**: Configuring GStreamer pipelines can be intricate and requires a deep understanding of the framework.
- **Image Processing Limitations**: GStreamer may be less straightforward for simple image processing tasks compared to OpenCV, making some operations more complex to implement.

**3.5 Why GStreamer Version:**
- Certain hardware platforms, such as TI boards, do not support OpenCV for image streaming effectively.
- GStreamer is suitable for low-level image handling and is less resource-intensive than OpenCV.

#### **4. Python Version**

**4.1 Design Overview:**
- **Model Loading**: Utilizes ONNX Runtime in Python for model management and inference.
- **Preprocessing**: Uses OpenCV for reading, resizing, and normalizing images, taking advantage of Python's simplicity.
- **Postprocessing**: Analyzes the output tensor with NumPy to determine the predicted class.

**4.2 Design Choices:**
- **Python Language**: Selected for its ease of use and rapid development capabilities. Python is highly suitable for prototyping and development.
- **OpenCV for Preprocessing**: Consistent with the C++ approach, OpenCV simplifies image processing tasks in Python.
- **ONNX Runtime**: Ensures consistency in model execution across different implementations.

**4.3 Workflow:**
1. Load the model using ONNX Runtime in Python.
2. Preprocess the image with OpenCV: load, resize, and normalize.
3. Perform inference with the model.
4. Postprocess the output to find the predicted class.

**4.4 Limitations:**
- **Performance**: Python generally offers slower performance compared to C++. Inference might be less efficient, especially for real-time applications.
- **Resource Usage**: Python, combined with OpenCV, can be more memory-intensive, which may not be ideal for resource-constrained environments.
- **Less Control**: Python abstracts many lower-level details, which can complicate fine-tuning and performance optimization.
